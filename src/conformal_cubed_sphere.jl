    conformal_cubed_sphere_mapping(x, y; W_map=W_Rancic)

Conformal mapping from a face of a cube onto the equivalent sector of a sphere with unit radius.

Map the north-pole face of a cube with coordinates ``(x, y)`` onto the equivalent sector of the
sphere with coordinates ``(X, Y, Z)``.

The cube's face oriented normal to ``z``-axis and its coordinates must lie within the
range ``-1 ≤ x ≤ 1``, ``-1 ≤ y ≤ 1`` with its center at ``(x, y) = (0, 0)``. The coordinates
``X, Y`` increase in the same direction as ``x, y``.

The numerical conformal mapping used here is described by [Rancic-etal-1996](@citet).

This is a Julia translation of [MATLAB code from MITgcm](http://wwwcvs.mitgcm.org/viewvc/MITgcm/MITgcm_contrib/high_res_cube/matlab-grid-generator/map_xy2xyz.m?view=markup) that is based on
Fortran 77 code from Jim Purser & Misha Rančić.

Examples
========

The center of the cube's face ``(x, y) = (0, 0)`` is mapped onto ``(X, Y, Z) = (0, 0, 1)``

```jldoctest
julia> using CubedSphere

julia> conformal_cubed_sphere_mapping(0, 0)
(0, 0, 1.0)
```

and the edge of the cube's face at ``(x, y) = (1, 1)`` is mapped onto ``(X, Y, Z) = (√3/3, √3/3, √3/3)``

```jldoctest
julia> using CubedSphere

julia> conformal_cubed_sphere_mapping(1, 1)

    conformal_cubed_sphere_inverse_mapping(X, Y, Z; Z_map=Z_Rancic)

Inverse mapping for conformal cube sphere for quadrant of North-pole face in which `X` and `Y` are both
positive. All other mappings to other cube face coordinates can be recovered from rotations of this map.
There a 3 other quadrants for the north-pole face and five other faces for a total of twenty-four quadrants.
Because of symmetry only the reverse for a single quadrant is needed. Because of branch cuts and the complex
transform the inverse mappings are multi-valued in general, using a single quadrant case allows a simple
set of rules to be applied.

The mapping is valid for the cube face quadrant defined by ``0 < x < 1`` and ``0 < y < 1``, where a full cube
face has extent ``-1 < x < 1`` and ``-1 < y < 1``. The quadrant for the mapping is from a cube face that has
"north-pole" at its center ``(x=0, y=0)``. i.e., has `X, Y, Z = (0, 0, 1)` at its center. The valid ranges of `X`
and `Y` for this mapping and convention are a quadrant defined be geodesics that connect the points A, B, C and D,
on the shell of a sphere of radius ``R`` with `X`, `Y` coordinates as follows

```
A = (0, 0)
B = (√2, 0)
C = (√3/3, √3/3)
D = (0, √2)
