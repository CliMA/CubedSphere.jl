CubedSphere.jl Release Notes
===============================

v0.3.0
------

We moved `conformal_map_tylor_coefficients.jl` and `complex_jacobi_ellptic.jl`
from main package to `sandbox`. This allowed us to remove most dependencies of
`CubedSphere.jl`. `sandbox` now contains a Julia environment with the packages
needed to execute the scripts in that folder.
